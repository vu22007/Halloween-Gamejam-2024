## Development Process
- Unity Engine, Coding in C#
- All art done by Jacque with exception to the font which is Thaleah, found on the Unity asset store
- Having used a Kanban before, all of us thought it would be best to employ a [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/vu22007/projects/2)
- Issues were used as a way of organising work between members, allthough quality and frequency of issues put up decreased as we drew closer to the end of our time
- All ideas and concepts were group contributions
- Jacque as project manager as he had experience using Unity

## What features would we add given more time
- Lots of balancing with stats and wave difficulty spikes
- Different enemies with ranged attacks etc.
- More abilities, powerups and different weapons
- Lots of versatility and potential

## What we did well
- I believe we did things in the right order, first making a skeleton of empty classes and functions so that they can be filled in with ease, not having to worry about class structure, inheritence etc.
- Our members which have never used Unity before, by the end of it, were feeling infinitely more confident with the technology
- Any bugs were identified and crushed immediately
- The game feels smooth 
- Made nice, clear code with very readable functions and variables

## Installation
- Download the ApocalypseHero1.0.zip file, unzip and play (Mac only unfortunately)
